2.   divides the loaded picture into 16 pieces (3 equally divided sections in the x-axis and 3 equally divided sections in the y-axis)
3.   takes the first 15 pieces and arranged them randomly in a square 4x4
4.   allows you to arrange all 15 pieces in right position (by "drag and drop" method).The application will also count strokes that the user had made. The resulting number will be continuously displayed.

The layout of the web page should be designed only using CSS styles that will be defined in one external CSS file.
